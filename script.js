She clutched her small handbag close to her chest as she hurried toward the bus stand, her heart quietly blooming with excitement.\n\nHome — a word that once meant nothing to her — now carried the fragrance of love, warmth, and belonging.\n\nThe bus was crowded, but she didn’t mind. She found a seat near the window and looked out — people rushing home from work, children tugging at parents’ hands, vendors closing stalls — everyone seemed to belong somewhere.\n\nShe rested her head lightly against the glass and imagined the hug she would soon melt into when she stepped through the door. Her mother’s voice rang in her mind: “Tu aa gayi beta?”\n\nShe didn’t know that fate had already changed its course. Some destinations do not reveal themselves until it is too late.",

She didn’t know when her heartbeat had surrendered.\n\nThe world had faded out, not slowly, not gently — but violently, like a candle crushed under a merciless hand.\n\nAnd then… silence.\n\nNot the silence she knew — peaceful or restful — but a hollow, starless silence that pressed against her chest like thick smoke. She tried to breathe, to move, but her body was gone. Only her consciousness remained, suspended in emptiness.\n\nSomewhere ahead, a distant glow appeared, faint at first, then brightening like dawn breaking inside darkness. She did not walk toward it; she was pulled.\n\nSlowly, the realization struck her — she was no longer among the living. Her last memory of Earth was suffering, and her first memory of the afterlife was emptiness.\n\nNothing felt heavier than that truth.\n"

The light beneath her feet shaped a path — soft, luminous, weightless.

Her grief had followed her even here.\n\nThen she felt it — a pull, gentle yet firm — guiding her deeper inside this strange realm. Not a voice, not a touch, just a knowing: She was being summoned.\n\nThe path widened into a corridor of radiant light, and for the first time since her death, her grief rose like a tide.

Not with courage, not with reverence, but with pain.\n\n“Why?” she whispered. “Why me?”\n\nTears she no longer physically had burned through her spirit. “I just… wanted to go home. I had dreams, I had promises, I had my mother waiting. I was orphaned once, and I accepted it. And then, when I finally found a family… you took that away too? What evil deed did I do to deserve this? Why does she still suffer while the ones who killed me roam freely?”\n\nThe presence remained still, infinite, wordless. Silence — heavier than any punishment — answered her questions with nothing.\n"

I’ve been where you are,” the second spirit replied. “I’ve screamed silently, begged for justice that never came, and carried the memory of it.”\n\nShe offered her story, not for comparison, but to show that grief could be shared, that even in this new world, they were not alone.\n",

And maybe, if enough souls remember, the cries that were ignored may awaken justice.”\n\nThe first spirit nodded. “We bear witness — for our mothers, for children, for those who cannot speak. We may not bring justice, but we will not allow the world to forget.”\n\nHeaven pulsed with quiet understanding. No answers were given. No words spoken. And yet, in the shared presence of two wounded souls, there was recognition, affirmation, and the faintest glimmer of peace.\n\nThey would never forget. They would never forgive Earth entirely. But they would endure.\n\nBecause even in a world that had failed them, and even in heaven’s silence, truth remained unbroken.\n"

Her lullaby was so beautiful that nightmares couldn't exist in her presence, and every child dreamed of wonderful things.\n\nAmong these children was Luna, a six-year-old girl who loved Melody more than anyone. She would climb the hill every evening to listen to the dragon sing, watching stars twinkle in time with the music.\n\nThe Silent Night\n\nOne terrible evening, Melody's song stopped mid-verse. The dragon had lost her voice! Without the lullaby, nightmares crept into the village. Children woke crying, afraid of the dark for the first time.\n\nMelody tried to sing but could only manage a whisper. She touched her throat with her claw and made a writing motion in the dirt: 'The Song of Stars. Dream Realm. Help.'\n\nLuna understood. The Song of Stars was a magical melody that existed in the Dream Realm, where all songs were born. Melody needed someone to retrieve it. And Luna, though small and scared, knew she had to try.\n\nThe Dream Realm Journey\n\nThat night, Luna fell asleep holding a scale Melody had given her. In her dreams, she found herself in the Dream Realm—a place where the sky was made of sleeping thoughts and clouds were formed from wishes.\n\nShe faced the Nightmare King, who had stolen the Song of Stars because he was lonely and wanted someone to listen to his own sad melody. Luna, with the kindness only a child possesses, listened to his song. She told him it was beautiful, but it shouldn't silence others' songs.\n\nTouched by her compassion, the Nightmare King released the Song of Stars.

Space itself seemed alive, responding to their presence. Zara reported that the ship's hull was absorbing starlight and somehow converting it to consciousness.\n\n'The ship is learning,' she said. 'It's becoming aware.'\n\nMarcus detected patterns in the cosmic background radiation—not random noise, but language. The universe itself was speaking to them, telling a story billions of years old.\n\nLog Entry 087: The Truth\n\nThey found the source of the signal: a structure larger than a galaxy, built from crystallized time itself. Inside, they met the Architects—beings of pure energy who had seeded life throughout the universe, including on Earth.\n\n'You call this your first journey beyond,' the Architects communicated, 'but your ancestors stood where you stand now, eons ago. You are not discovering the universe. You are remembering it.'\n\nHumanity, they learned, was part of an ancient cycle.
